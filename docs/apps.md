# App Suggestions

This section is for apps that may work better either for the processor, the e-ink screen, or the resolution, in no particular order.

### Keyboard
    Minimal Keyboard

Gboard, while great, does not work super well with the physical keyboard on the phone.

### Camera
caseyls, silentace07, and alfonso mantero are a few individuals from discord who looked into the camera a lot. Based on their findings, the recommended camera setup is
    
    OpenCamera, Camera2api set, NR (default) setting 

### E-Reader
    KO Reader & Moonreader

### Launchers
    Minimal Launcher, Before Launcher, Niagara Launcher, OLauncher

Launcher work a bit like a desktop in some ways. Minimal Launcher will obviously be updated by the team at TMC, but people have found success with these other launchers, as well as nova (prime).

### Shortcuts
    Key Mapper

Check out app "Key Mapper" it will allow you to set specific functions for any key on the keyboard, depending on what app you have open, or if media is playing.  You can even set it to do emulated screen taps.  I have my phone set up now when you double tap enter on the main minimal screen it swipes up into the app drawer and then auto taps on the search bar so you can just start tapping to search for an app    

### Web browser
    Einkbro

The web was not optimized for e-ink screens, however, "Einkbro" helps bridge the gap. This browser includes volume key paginated scrolling, reading mode, OpenAI integration (for generating page summaries), and many other optimization for e-ink.
