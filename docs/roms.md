# Custom Roms & De-Googling
This would be considered an "Advanced" section. Either for Advanced users who are familiar with roms etc., or for people who are inerested in more advanced features, namely more granular control over the device. A discord user is currently working on a GSI build on his own time.

## GSI Based on Evolution X
Neural Nonsense has made a patching service for an existing image, and brought over necessary minimal phone features. You can find the github page [here](https://github.com/vbbot/minimal-phone-patching-service). If you want some more info on the build or what went into it, you can
checkout his blog [here](https://vbh.ai/hibreak-pro-gsi-release/). 

Note: This is not a de-googled rom.
