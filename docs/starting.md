# Getting Started

## Setting Up Your Sim Card
user tc64 typed it up nicely

Just a PSA to anyone trying to get this phone working on T-mobile — if you have an iPhone 14, US model (which is eSIM only) and are trying to switch to Minimal which needs a physical SIM, I couldn't activate it directly because T-mobile is convinced that this phone is "not an unlocked device" LOL.

This means that in order to switch from iPhone 14 to Minimal, you have to have a third "temporary" phone (i'm using some old iPhone SE) that you activate the physical SIM on instead, and then swap the SIM card to the Minimal later

(if you've always been using a physical SIM it will work fine — this is relevant specifically for people switching from eSIM-only devices) 

## Android Setup
Follow the prompts on the screen to set up the device. There are a few things to note:

### Transferring Data

Some users reported battery draining quickly while updating or transferring data from their existing phone (for android users), so it may be a good idea to be fully charged, or use a usb-c splitter to charge while transferring data.

### Setting up Fingerprint
from google docs created by marshall
There is a fingerprint sensor in the power button on the right side of the phone. When you are configuring your fingers it appears that there is no feedback on the screen because the e-ink is not great but you just have to gently take your finger off and on the fingerprint sensor like 20 times until it is registered.


## First Steps After Setup
### System Updates
After going through the initial setup, you'll want to make sure you have the latest updates. E-Paper is pretty new to android so the team is working on updates and those will likely improve the experience of the phone noticably with each update 

    Settings -> System -> System Updates

To access settings, swipe down from the top twice, hit the cog icon, and then look for system, or just use the search bar.

### Checking Duraspeed
There is an setting called duraspeed which can sometimes aggresively kill apps to perserve battery. Your mileage may vary, but it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with it (more on this in troubleshooting)

## E-Ink Settings
Hold the refresh button between the volume keys on the side of the phone to open the quick settings that allow adjustment of screen backlight, keyboard backlight, and screen refresh speeds.
Tap the the refresh button once to eliminating ghosting on the e-ink screen


## Android Navigation
### Three navigations buttons
Above your keyboard there are three navigation buttons. Back, Home, and Recent Apps

!!! note "Quick Switch to Last App"
    You can switch back and forth between the last two opened apps by double tapping the App Overview button on the right.

Quick settings and refresh
Hold the refresh button between the volume keys on the side of the phone to open the quick settings that allow adjustment of screen backlight, keyboard backlight, and screen refresh speeds.
