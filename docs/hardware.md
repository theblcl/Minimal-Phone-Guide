## Screen

### Frontlight
from jordan on discord, how to turn off the frontlight (until an official fix is released):

Slide the brightness slider all the way down and without letting go of it just yet, drag it up SLIGHTLY till you see the light turn on, let go and once you exit the eink app it will turn off.

### Locking the Screen
from resolveduser1 on discord, if you are having some difficulty determining whether the screen is locked or not

It helped me to make sure I had the backlight on some while testing because when the phone locks , the backlight will shut off . Once I discovered that , it helped me understand when the phone locked and when it didn't . Now , I trust that the phone locks when I press the button .

One other thing that got me was that if you hold your unlock finger over the power button after a single click to lock , it will unlock itself again . This was hard to understand before I used the backlight trick above .

### Stop screen from waking for every notification
This is a personal preference, but a tip from user j4sb3rg on discord

1. Settings-notifications-notifications wake screen

2. lock screen-wake screen for notifications

### Refresh Speeds
Please click the "i" button for more information for your setting. But one misconception is the "hybrid" speed is the "middle speed." No it is not. It is a beta-test of an adaptive model switching between Slow Speed (low refresh rate for reading and minimal use) and Ultra Speed (higher fresh rate at the cost of details for playing video and heavy use).
!!! note "Note"
    There may be a bug when adjusting speeds. this is currently being investigated.

## Keyboard
### General Issues
If you are having issues with the keyboard, check to make sure you are using the Minimal Keyboard

Go to Settings

1. Select On-Screen Keyboard

2. Turn off Gboard

We're aware of one more slight issue with the keyboard:

Issue: Holding down the SHIFT or ALT key while typing quickly may not register correctly.

Temporary Fix: Instead of holding down the key, tap or double-tap (to lock) SHIFT or ALT before selecting the desired character

### Period/Mic Button
In the Minimal Keyboard settings, there is an option for the mic button to act as a dedicated period button

### Disabling Autocorrect
Some users may want to disable autocorrect if it is feeling too aggressive, and this can also be done in the Minimal Keyboard settings

### Disabling Auto-capitalization
If you're experiencing issues where the first character of every line is always capitalized (even when holding shift), you can disable this feature in the Minimal Keyboard Settings. Simply open Minimal Keyboard Settings and disable the "auto-capitalize" option.

### WASD Mode
If you want to use WASD for a directional pad such as for games, you can double tap ALT then press SYM. You will notice a directional icon appear in your status bar at the top.
To get out of this mode, press SYM once more.
Note that when you are in this mode, your characters symbols on the keyboard will rearrange such as ALT+M will be an “=” instead of a “,”

### International Use
from user unknownwelle
For international users who type more than English:

1. Download Microsoft Swiftkey Keyboard,
2. Disable all other keyboards in the keyboard settings,
Then, you can use Microsoft Swiftkey Keyboard with all the functionalities but can still use multiple languages. Note the on-screen keyboard may appear at times, but once you start typing, it would disappear
