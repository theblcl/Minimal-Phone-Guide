# Tips and Tricks

This is a running collection of tips and tricks from the community for using the Minimal Phone.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- **Double-click Enter/Space**: puts the device to sleep

## Keymapper
This is a section dedicated to different keymapper layouts that users have tried. Could be useful to use a tried and true layout, or be inspired to create your own.

i used key mapper to map mic to down arrow, shift+mic to up, emoji to left, and sym to right

this solved the issue for me. note that key mapper means you give up autocorrect (which is fine for me) and have to manually set up every alt key shortcut. it was worth it for me

in addition, i also used key mapper to access all of the missing keys through the right shift key.

for example, in order, i made right shift +...
q w e r t: map to ` ( ) { }
a s d f g: map to ~ [ ] < >
z x c v: map to / \ ^ |

and:
shift+space | page up
right shift+space | page down
shift+sym | tab
alt+sym | esc
alt+space | alt-tab

in addition, i still have the entire right half of the keyboard free for even more right shift keybindings -- for example, quick app launch shortcuts
